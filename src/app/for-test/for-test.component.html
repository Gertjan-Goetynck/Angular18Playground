<!-- track is required, fill in the unique identifier of what you are looping through -->
<p>New for loop syntax. Note that from now on we also need to add the "track" value. This value is the unique identifier
    of the items that are being looped over.</p>
@for(test of testArray; track test){
<p>{{test}}</p>
